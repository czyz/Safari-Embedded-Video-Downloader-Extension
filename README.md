# YouTube Video de-embedder/Downloader Safari Extension

A Safari extension that automatically detects YouTube videos on web pages and provides convenient controls for opening the video in a new tab and for generating the command-line for downloading videos (with yt-dlp or curl where appropriate).

This extension was vibe-coded with Cursor as a lark. Most of this README too. I needed this and threw a couple prompts at the problem and probably evaporated away the amount of water needed to slake the thirst of a small country in the process, but I'm impressed things have gotten to the point where something that seems functional and is this complex can come out the other side. I wouldn't advise trusting this code to operate heavy equipment or your pacemaker.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Detects YouTube videos in various formats:
  - `lite-youtube` elements
  - YouTube iframe embeds
  - `shreddit-embed` elements with YouTube content

- **Video Information**: Displays the YouTube video ID above each detected video

- **Direct YouTube Link**: Provides a button to open the video directly on YouTube

- **Download with yt-dlp**: Copies yt-dlp command to clipboard for YouTube videos
- **Download with curl**: Copies curl command to clipboard for Reddit videos
- **Configurable cookies**: Settings to specify which browser's cookies to use for authentication

## Installation

**Note**: Safari extensions can only be installed from the Mac App Store. This extension is provided as open source for developers and enthusiasts who want to build and run it locally.

### Build from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/czyz/Safari-Embedded-Video-Downloader-Extension.git
   cd Safari-Embedded-Video-Downloader-Extension
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking `Youtube embed to URL.xcodeproj`
3. Build and run the project (‚åò+R)
4. The extension will be automatically installed in Safari
5. Go to **Safari > Settings > Extensions** and enable the extension by checking the checkbox

### System Requirements

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Safari 15.0 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for building from source)
- For video downloads: `yt-dlp` (install via `brew install yt-dlp`)

## Usage

1. Navigate to any webpage that contains YouTube videos
2. The extension will automatically detect YouTube videos and add control panels above them
3. Each control panel shows:
   - The YouTube video ID
   - An "Open on YouTube" button (opens the video on YouTube.com)
   - A "Download with yt-dlp" button

### Downloading Videos

When you click the "Download" button:

1. The appropriate command is automatically copied to your clipboard:
   - **YouTube videos**: yt-dlp command
   - **Reddit videos**: curl command
2. The button briefly shows "Command Copied!" to confirm
3. Open Terminal manually
4. Paste and run the command

**Note**: 
- For YouTube videos, you need to have `yt-dlp` installed on your system. You can install it with:
  ```bash
  brew install yt-dlp
  ```
- For Reddit videos, `curl` is included with macOS by default

### Settings

The extension includes a settings panel where you can configure:

- **Cookies from browser**: Choose which browser's cookies to use for authentication when downloading videos. Options include:
  - Safari (default)
  - Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Chromium, Opera, Vivaldi, Whale
  - None (no cookies)

This setting is useful if you're logged into YouTube in a different browser than Safari, or if you want to download videos without using cookies.
